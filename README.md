## Cybersecurity Projects 

### Home Network and Cybersecurity Lab

> **Note:** The original documentation and processes were more complex and detailed than what is presented here. Due to security considerations related to sharing network details online, several steps and specifics have been omitted. 

This project is a small home lab with a straightforward design focused on experimentation, ethical hacking, and controlled penetration testing. It has provided me with hands-on experience with a wide range of network and cybersecurity topics.

I've essentially recreated a portion of the virtual environment and machines that exist in my University's lab. These include Kali
Linux, Metasploitable2, OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project), WebGoat, and Damn Vulnerable Web App. This provides a 
safe environment to explore security, vulnerabilities, exploits, and conduct controlled penetration tests. This lab will remain a valuable 
resource post-graduation, allowing me to continue learning independently.

A significant challenge I faced was integrating the lab with my existing home network and devices. Although the network itself is simple, integrating 
the new equipment without impacting existing functionality required careful planning and configuration. This project allowed me to develop practical skills in network segmentation, 
device configuration, and maintaining a controlled environment for ethical hacking.

The setup is flexible and scalable. While it‚Äôs still a work in progress, the setup is complete, and I‚Äôm finalizing the documentation to share here soon.
