## Cybersecurity Projects 

### Home Network and Cybersecurity Lab
This project is a small home lab with a simple design. Its purpose is experimentation, ethical hacking, and controlled penetration testing. It has helped me gain hands-on experience with many different topics.
<details>
<summary>üîéClick to Reveal Essential Topics üîç</summary>
  
- Integrating new equipment into an existing network
- Device configuration
- Subnetting
- VLANs
- Firewall rules
- IP assignments
- DHCP
- DNS
- Virtualization
- Vulnerability scanning
- Host/network hardening
- Penetration Testing

</details>

I have essentially recreated much of the virtual environment and machines that exist in my University's lab. These include Kali
Linux, Metasploitable2, OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project), WebGoat, and Damn Vulnerable Web App. This provides a 
safe environment to learn about security, vulnerabilities, exploits, and carry out controlled penetration testing. 
I will be able to use and upscale this rich learning environment long after I graduate and don't have access to the school's resources. 

The best part is that I can say I have designed, constructed, and configured it all from the ground up. It is a humble lab, but it is my first lab, 
and I am proud of the work I've done. It is still a work in progress, but the majority of the setup work is complete. The documentation
simply needs to be finalized, and I will upload it here.</p>

### Raspberry Pi Hacking Devices: Building and Testing<i> (For Ethical Hacking and Analysis)</i>
  #### These devices are already built: documentation pending
  <ul>
    <li>Pwnagotchi: WiFi Deauthenticator and Handshake Capture (meant for further cracking of Wi-Fi AP passwords)</li>
    <li>P4wnP1 ALOA: Bad USB device (flexible USB device seen as HID by host and capable of keystroke injection, payloads, data exfiltration, MITM attacks, etc.)</li>
  </ul>
