## Cybersecurity Projects 

### Home Network and Cybersecurity Lab
This project is a small home lab with a straightforward design focused on experimentation, ethical hacking, and controlled penetration testing. It has provided me with hands-on experience with a wide range of network and cybersecurity topics.
<details>
<summary>üîéClick to Reveal Essential Topics üîç</summary>
  
- Integrating new equipment into an existing network
- Device configuration
- Subnetting
- VLANs
- Firewall rules
- IP assignments
- DHCP
- DNS
- Virtualization
- Vulnerability scanning
- Host/network hardening
- Penetration Testing

</details>

I've essentially recreated a portion of the virtual environment and machines that exist in my University's lab. These include Kali
Linux, Metasploitable2, OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project), WebGoat, and Damn Vulnerable Web App. This provides a 
safe environment to explore security, vulnerabilities, exploits, and conduct controlled penetration tests. This lab will remain a valuable 
resource post-graduation, allowing me to continue learning independently.

One significant challenge was integrating the lab with my existing home network and devices. Although the network itself is simple, ensuring smooth integration 
without impacting existing functionality required careful planning and configuration. This process has allowed me to develop practical skills in network segmentation, 
device configuration, and maintaining a controlled environment for ethical hacking.

I‚Äôm proud of this lab as my first major cybersecurity project. While it‚Äôs still a work in progress, the setup is complete, and I‚Äôm finalizing the documentation to share here soon.

 #### *More to come: Work in progress*
  - [Lab Phase 1: Design and equiment considerations](https://github.com/blaine-geiger/Lab-Phase-1)
  - [Lab Phase 2: Installation and configuration of devices](https://github.com/blaine-geiger/Lab-Phase-2)
  - [Lab Phase 3: Network functionality and performance testing](https://github.com/blaine-geiger/Lab-Phase-3)
  - [Lab Phase 4: Ensure virtualization capability and install virtual machines](https://github.com/blaine-geiger/Lab-Phase-5)

#### Automation Phase: Integrate a Raspberry Pi 5 to automate firewall logging, network monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, secure VPN setup, lightweight SIEM with ELK stack, alerting with fail2ban, automated log backups, and configuration management for network devices.
